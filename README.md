# Convolution

This is a C program which takes four inputs: 1) Length of your input signal 2) Length of the Filter coefficients vector 3) The input signal (make sure that it is causal i.e. starts at t = 0) 4) The Filter coefficients vector

After taking these inputs the program calculates the convolution output of the two signals using the convolution formula.
